Here at last is the definitive book on how to make a pop-up. Every aspect of the creation of a pop-up, known as paper engineering, is clearly and thoroughly covered. All types of parallel folds, angle folds, wheels, and pull tabs are accurately detailed verbally and visually, flat and in dimension. Also included is a history of pop-ups and a step-by-step photographic essay on how a pop-up is made from start to finish. This guided tour is perfect for aspiring pop-up creators, paper engineers, students, and appreciators of this unique art form.
I bought it so i can use it with my 5, now 6-year-old, child to make some interesting cards. However, a child's patience runs out by the time you figure it out or you have to try it on your own first before doing it with a child.

Review: When you first open the cover of this amazing book, you will be ASTOUNDED by the pop-up on the first page - one of the most incredible I've ever seen in a mass-marketed book - and you will immediately want to learn how to do something like that! However, be forewarned: this is NOT a how-to book. You won't be given a tidy list of instructions: "Fold line A, cut at B, join to C, fold and WALLA! A dinosaur!" What you WILL get is all the building blocks you need, in the form of examples of every conceivable type of pop-up mechanism (including ones you've probably never seen before, like neat-o spinning disks), to make incredible pop-ups like the one on the first page. This is more of a pop-up dictionary. It's an amazing overview, and the examples - all of which are neatly arranged into individual categories based on type of pop-up mechanism, and all of which can be taken apart and put back together to explore the mechanics - are inspiring. It's up to your spirit of exploration and creativity to figure out what sort of pop-ups you can create using these ideas. The easiest pop-up folds are marked with an "easy" star (sadly, not too many are "easy," but that's the world of pop-ups for you). I wished that there were clearer directions on the difficult examples, though - some are tricky to figure out just by taking them apart (I wanted to know if I was trying to use a particular fold how I would figure out how much space to leave, how to figure out what to glue first, etc. But there's much to be said for trial and error. I've figured out quite a few already.) Overall, though, it's a great book, and an invaluable resource for budding pop-up artists. I'm very glad I bought it!
